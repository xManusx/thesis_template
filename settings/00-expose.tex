\section*{Concrete Goals}
Concrete goals for this thesis include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		Examining differences between \ac{nb} and \ac{lte}.
		Although \ac{nb} is directly based on the \ac{lte} standard and uses the same cellular network, it is not backward compatible with \ac{lte} and prior standards such as \acs{gsm} and \acs{umts}.
		Many features of \ac{lte} are not supported, including very basic operations, such as handovers \cite{whitepaper}.
	\item
		Defining security goals for \ac{iot} \ac{mtc} and an appropriate attacker model.
		Those are crucial parts of every in-depth security analysis.
		Security analyses of traditional \ac{lte} have defined security goals and attacker models before \cite{inspector}.
		However, for cellular \ac{mtc} different security goals might be appropriate. 
	\item
		Finding literature on known attacks on \ac{lte} and related standards (\acs{umts}, \acs{gsm}) and finding an appropriate taxonomy to classify attacks according to different properties.
		Examples for known attacks can be found in \citet{inspector}, \citet{kune2012location}, \citet{mitmumts}, or \citet{shaik2015practical}, among others.
		
	\item
		Analyzing whether attacks concern \ac{lte} \ac{nb}.
		The lack of some \ac{lte} features in \ac{nb} could render certain attacks unfeasible;
		for example, an attack against the handover procedure cannot be possible as there simply is no such thing in the \ac{nb} standard.

	\item
		Implementing chosen attacks -- possibly the most concerning ones -- using \ac{nb} equipment in a lab setting.
		This way, the theoretical considerations regarding possible attacks would validated by tests with real \ac{lte} \ac{nb} hardware.
	%\item
		%Which concrete (part-) goals do I want to solve on my way to solve the problem statement?
\end{enumerate}
